Reviewer \#1 (Comments for the Author):

This manuscript assesses the impact of aquifer thickness on agricultural
production during drought in the area overlying the High Plains aquifer
in the central United States. The authors use crop, meteorological, and
aquifer thickness data in regressions to develop relationships among
these quantities. Their most important finding is the impact of aquifer
thickness on productivity during drought and the ramifications for
aquifer conservation efforts. I have read this manuscript over a number
of times and found it of considerable interest and worthy of publication
in Nature Water. However, I do have a few concerns that I wanted to
bring to the attention of the authors. My most important concerns are as
follows (not necessarily in order of importance):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Aquifer thickness versus saturated thickness -- The authors speak of
  ``aquifer saturated thickness'', which is a redundant term. Remember,
  the definition of an aquifer is a saturated unit -- there is no
  unsaturated aquifer. Please use ``aquifer thickness'' to avoid
  propagating this confusing usage into the future.
\end{enumerate}

\textcolor{blue}{ferkjnf}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Dependence on aquifer thickness -- I had a number of questions about
  the relationships displayed in Figure 1. First, the regression appears
  to have been done year by year. Are the quantiles recalculated each
  year to reflect that there may be changes between categories as time
  goes on? Second, when the authors state the lowest quantile goes from
  0 to 33\% are they assuming that the minimum thickness of 9 m is the
  zero point? Third, I assume that the county and year fixed effects are
  calculated as part of the regression. Are there any insights that can
  be gained from the interpretation of those quantities? Fourth, the
  authors need to point out that the same aquifer thickness can result
  in dramatically different transmissive characteristics. Thus, a
  relatively thin aquifer interval composed of coarse sands and gravels
  may be more resilient to drought than a much thicker aquifer dominated
  by fine sands and silts. Could that be a major player in the error
  bars in the plots? Please mention this at some point in the
  manuscript.
\item
  Conditioned on drought risk exposure -- I wasn't sure what the authors
  meant by this in the second paragraph of Section 2.2. This must be
  related to the water deficit but the lack of explanation in the main
  text or the methods section left me wondering. Please clarify at some
  point in the manuscript.
\item
  Equation 2 -- Please define all terms in the equation and provide an
  explanation of what is meant by ``estimated semi-parametrically''.
\item
  Kansas and California efforts -- I've seen a number of papers
  describing efforts in Kansas and California to address aquifer
  depletion via LEMAs (Kansas) and SGMA (California). The 1985-2016
  period examined by the authors was before most of the efforts in
  Kansas got started. My understanding is that the first LEMA was
  established in 2013 but then no more were set up until after 2016.
  This manuscript would be more impactful if the authors could speculate
  on how their relationships might change with greater attention to
  groundwater conservation. For example, I would think the decrease in
  yield the authors observe with negative water deficits would disappear
  when the irrigators are using soil moisture sensors and are focused on
  water-use efficiency. I would expect changes as well for tipping
  points.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Minor points}\label{minor-points}}

Section 1, 3rd Paragraph -- ``Two aquifer pathways exist through aquifer
depletion will..'' -- confusing sentence -- please replace ``through''
with ``by which''.

Section 1, 4th Paragraph -- ``we generate empirical evidence'' seems
awkward to me. How about replacing with ``we present empirical
evidence''? Next sentence -- ``Our analysis advances on
previous\ldots{}'' reads better as ``Our analysis extends
previous\ldots{}'' There are many issues such as these and the previous
comment. Please address such issues so that the manuscript is an easier
read.

Section 2.1 title -- I would delete ``marginally'' as it is not needed
and some will find it confusing.

Figure 2 - Why do the plots stop at a thickness of about 12 m when you
had earlier defined the minimum thickness as 9 m and mention 10 m in the
text when discussing the relationships?

Section 2.3, First Paragraph -- please clarify that ``average per-area
production'' is a combination of irrigated and rainfed yields. That
would make the manuscript easier to follow.

Figure 5 -- I assume that the left plot is corn and the right soybean,
but please clarify.

Data and Code Availability -- Are the data from Dr.~Haacker on the
Github repository? Please place them there prior to publication so
future investigators can access them rather than having to track down
Dr.~Haacker. The data set is over seven years old so it should be made
available according to the principles of open science.

Line before Equation (2) -- ``REF'' should be replaced with the actual
reference.

Discussion, First Paragraph -- ``reduction in aquifer depletion'' should
be ``reduction in aquifer thickness''.

Section 4.2, 3rd Paragraph -- ``the the impact'' -- remember to spell
and grammar check prior to submission.

Reference in Section 3 -- I doubt that ``Butler Jr'' is the surname,
please replace with ``Butler''. Suffixes apparently aren't handled well
by some of the bibliography generation programs.

Please remember to close all parentheses and don't mispair brackets and
parentheses. Such stuff can raise questions about the care used in the
analysis.
