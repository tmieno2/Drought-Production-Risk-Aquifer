  abstract = {Abstract Landscape-scale ecological modelling has been hindered by suitable high-resolution surface meteorological datasets. To overcome these limitations, desirable spatial attributes of gridded climate data are combined with desirable temporal attributes of regional-scale reanalysis and daily gauge-based precipitation to derive a spatially and temporally complete, high-resolution (4-km) gridded dataset of surface meteorological variables required in ecological modelling for the contiguous United States from 1979 to 2010. Validation of the resulting gridded surface meteorological data, using an extensive network of automated weather stations across the western United States, showed skill comparable to that derived from interpolation using station observations, suggesting it can serve as suitable surrogate for landscape-scale ecological modelling across vast unmonitored areas of the United States.

  abstract  = {The study has been conducted in the newly developed by lift irrigation areas of Karshi steppe (Uzbekistan). The research questions included an assessment of the climate change impact on agricultural production. The studies allowed to examine main factors affecting the behavior of agricultural producers in the face of climate change, as well as their current practices and skills for adapting to the effects of climate change. As research results show, the impact of climate change on irrigated agriculture in the study areas has become especially tangible over the last decade. In this regard, situations arise with crop losses and reduced quality of agricultural products. According to research outcomes the agricultural producers have general information and general knowledge about climate change and its impact on agriculture. The most important consequences caused by the climate change impact on irrigated agricultural production include - increasing in water scarcity, growing in numbers of agricultural pests and plant diseases, declining in crop yields, instability and unpleasant weather surprises, the need to spend more labor and resources to get a satisfactory crop yield, salinization of land and water resources contamination, increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts and frosts, and others.}

  abstract  = {The climate change poses a great challenge to the agriculture sector compared to any other sector in the country as it is highly a weather dependent enterprise. The study results reveal that the climatic variation such as the occurrence of drought due to irregular distribution, lesser rainfall have a high level of impact on the dryland farming by adversely affecting the yield levels of the crops. The farmer\textquoteright{}s perception of the impact of climate change on the crops grown in Rainfed condition, such as yield reduction and reduction in net revenue. The farmers already act to the changes in the climatic changes both by adopting the technological coping mechanisms on the positive side and negatively through shifting to other professions especially more pronounced in dryland farming regions of the country. It is concluded that the small and medium Rainfed farmers were highly vulnerable to climate change and to a larger extent the small and medium Rainfed farmers adopted coping mechanisms for climate change compared to large farmers. The studies suggest that as the impact of climate change is intensifying day by day, it should be addressed through developing appropriate mitigation strategies and supported through policy perspective at the earliest to avoid short-term effects such as yield and income loss and long-term effects such as quitting agricultural profession by the dryland farmers of the country.}

  abstract  = {Increased irrigation has been identified as an important potential adaptation to meet growing world food demand. Yet many of the world's major irrigation regions are in arid and semi-arid regions that face climate change projections of hotter and drier weather. A growing body of analysis assesses irrigated agriculture impacts of climate change in such regions. Most published literature focuses on reductions in the mean-levels of freshwater supplies; less information is available on the potential impacts from changes in the reliability and quality of those diminishing water supplies. This article investigates the combined impacts on irrigated agricultural food supply from reduced, more variable and more saline water supply for a representative semi-arid irrigation region. Results indicate that understanding the potential impacts of climate change on agricultural production requires an understanding of not only how production may adapt to changes in mean water supplies, but also how it may respond to changes in water supply variability and salinity. We illustrate, using an Australian, Murray Darling Basin semi-arid region example, that ignoring these combined water-related climate effects lead to results that overlook thresholds where the structure of production and cost incurred fundamentally change above certain levels of variability and salinity.}

  abstract  = {Climate change is likely to have substantial effects on irrigated agriculture. Extreme climate events such as droughts are likely to become more common. These patterns are evident in median projections of climate change for the Murray--Darling Basin in Australia. Understanding climate change effects on returns from irrigation involves explicit representation of spatial changes in natural stocks (i.e. water supply) and their temporal variability (i.e. frequency of drought states of nature) and the active management responses to capital stocks represented by mitigation and alternative adaptation strategies by state of nature . A change in the frequency of drought will induce a change in the allocation of land and water between productive activities. In this paper, a simulation model of state-contingent production is used to analyze the effects of climate change adaptation and mitigation. In the absence of mitigation, climate change will have severe adverse effects on irrigated agriculture in the Basin. However, a combination of climate mitigation and adaptation through changes in land and water use will allow the maintenance of agricultural water use and environmental flows.}

  abstract  = {Dryland agroecosystems could be a sizable sink for atmospheric carbon (C) due to their spatial extent and level of degradation, providing climate change mitigation. We examined productivity and soil C dynamics under two climate change scenarios (moderate warming, representative concentration pathway [RCP] 4.5; and high warming, RCP 8.5), using long-term experimental data and the DayCent process-based model for three sites with varying climates and soil conditions in the US High Plains. Each site included a no-till cropping intensity gradient introduced in 1985, with treatments ranging from wheat-fallow ( L.) to continuous annual cropping and perennial grass. Simulations were extended to 2100 using data from 16 global circulation models to estimate uncertainty. Simulated yields declined for all crops (up to 50% for wheat), with small changes after 2050 under RCP 4.5 and continued losses to 2100 under RCP 8.5. Of the cropped systems, continuous cropping had the highest average productivity and soil C sequestration rates (78.1 kg C ha yr from 2015 to 2045 under RCP 4.5). Any increase in soil C for cropped rotations was realized by 2050, but grassland treatments increased soil C (up to 69%) through 2100, even under RCP 8.5. Our simulations indicate that reduced frequency of summer fallow can both increase annualized yields and store more soil C. As evapotranspiration is likely to increase, reducing fallow periods without live vegetation from dryland agricultural rotations may enhance the resilience of these systems to climate change while also increasing soil C storage and mitigating carbon dioxide emissions.}

  abstract  = {The planet earth, on which we live in communities, is being increasingly 'ruptured' because of human activities; its carrying capacity is under great stress because of demographic pressures. The pressure is especially affecting the people living in the dry areas because of the marginal and fragile nature of the resources they have access to. There are over 2,000 million hectares of land that have been degraded, with a loss of agrobiodiversity, increased water scarcity and increased natural resource destruction. Superimposed on this is the fact that the neglectful and exploitive use of natural resources has set the train of global climate change in motion.It is anticipated that the impact of climate change will cut across all boundaries. Crops, cropping systems, rotations and biota will undergo transformation. To maintain the balance in the system, there is a need for new knowledge, alternative policies and institutional changes. The marginalized people in dry areas are likely to be most seriously hit by the shifts in moisture and temperature regimes as a result of the global climate change. To help them cope with the challenges, there is a need for a new paradigm in agricultural research and technology transfer that makes full use of modern science and technology in conjunction with traditional knowledge. This necessitates more investment by international agencies and national governments for supporting the relevant integrated research and sustainable development efforts, with full participation of the target communities. Only such an approach can enable the vulnerable communities of the dryland areas to use the natural resources in a sustainable manner and thus help protect the environment for future generations.The clock is ticking and the future of the world lies in the collective responsibility and wisdom of all nations on this planet. This should be reflected in the endorsement of a solid future plan.}

In course of time where the industrial revolution occurred in western countries and usage of the fossil fuels increased rapidly, on the other side the natural buffering system for climate change forests, were destroyed indiscriminately for want of fuel, fodder and timbers in the developing countries. These factors were intensified by the human activities in the past 250 years, which had tremendous impact on the climate system. According to the IPCC the green house gas emission could cause the mean global temperature to rise by another 1.4 C to 5.8 C. Already the symptoms of climate change were observed at a faster rate in the artic and under artic regions through melting of the frozen ice which have danger of submergence of the coastal zones. In the case of the inland water source, there is tremendous change in both surface as well as ground water due to erratic rainfall and occurrence of frequent droughts.}

  abstract = {Past research has advanced our knowledge of climate change impacts on grassland production and crop yields, yet the resilience of whole farm systems to climate change remains to be quantified. Here we examine how climates in 2040 influence the production and animal feed requirements of dryland and irrigated dairy farms in southern Australia, then contrast the resilience of adaptations that simplified or intensified baseline farm inputs and management. The effects of farm system simplification or intensification on seasonal pasture growth rates in mitigating adverse effects of climate change were small. Relative to historical climates, annual pasture production and livestock pasture consumption in 2040 on dryland farms decreased by \textasciitilde{}11% under baseline management or intensification, whereas adaptations that simplified systems resulted in little change in pasture production, pasture consumption or the need to purchase hay. The impact of climate change on annual pasture production and livestock pasture consumption of irrigated farms was less than that for dryland farms. In 2040 the need to purchase hay on the irrigated farm increased by 41% or 104% under baseline management or farming simplification, whereas purchased hay requirement under both historical and future climates under intensification was similar. Collectively these results suggest that the most effective adaptations in mitigating the effects of climate change on dryland and irrigated farms were simplification and intensification, respectively, but future work should address how climate and adaptation scenario influence profitability and risk.}

  abstract  = {In the last century, impacts of climate change phenomenon and its consequences such as changes in temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and amount of available water have been observed in various aspects of human life, especially in agricultural sector. In the agricultural sector, performance of irrigation networks is known as one of the important and effective factors on crop yield and development of sustainable agriculture. These networks can be affected by climate change because the irrigation networks are designed based on the climatic variables and crop pattern of considered region. In this chapter, sprinkler irrigation network of Bilesavar, located in the north of Iran, is considered as study area in order to investigate the effects of climate change on climatic variables. Moreover, according to existing agro-industry in the study area, the impacts of climate change are investigated on available crop pattern in order to specify conditions in the region in terms of maintaining sustainable agriculture. Since the most irrigation systems are designed based on the water requirement of crop pattern and water delivery based on farmer demand in the required pressure and discharge, the performance of irrigation network are evaluated in terms of equity and adequacy indices. Eventually, the adaptation strategies to climate change will be discussed for maintaining performance, stability of pressurized irrigation system, productivity improvement, and an increase in efficiency.}

These changes are likely to have very significant impacts on low rainfall agricultural regions already struggling with the economic demands of dryland salinity management. Potential negative impacts of climate change may include declining farm crop and pasture production, resulting in lower yields, greater yield variability, declining areas of cropping production as well as significant reductions in both farm profitability and the adoption of new practices needed to both adapt to and manage climate change and/or dryland salinisation. This analysis examines the potential impacts of climate change on a low rainfall region in the eastern wheatbelt of Western Australia, including climate change impacts on farm profit and salinity management options.}

  abstract  = {The changes in temperature and precipitation patterns along with increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) may change evapotranspiration (ET) demand, and affect water availability and crop production. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change and elevated CO2 on irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) in the Central Great Plains of Colorado was conducted using the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) model. One hundred and twelve bias corrected and spatially disaggregated (BCSD) climate projections were used to generate four different multi-model ensemble scenarios of climate change: three of the ensembles represented the A1B, A2, and B1 emission scenarios and the fourth comprised of all 112 BCSD projections. Three different levels of irrigation, based on meeting 100, 75, and 50% of the crop ET demand, were used to study the climate change effects on corn yield and water use efficiency (WUE) under full and deficit irrigation. Predicted increases in mean monthly temperature during the crop growing period varied from 1.4 to 1.9, 2.1 to 3.4, and 2.7 to 5.4\textdegree{}C during the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, for the different climate change scenarios. During the same periods, the projected changes in mean monthly precipitation varied in the range of \textminus{}4.5 to 1.7, \textminus{}6.6 to 4.0 and \textminus{}11.5 to 10.2%, respectively. Simulation results showed a decrease in corn yield, because the negative effects of increase in temperature dominated over the positive effects of increasing CO2 levels. The mean overall decrease in yield for the four different climate change scenarios, with full irrigation, ranged from 11.3 to 14.0, 17.1 to 21.0, and 20.7 to 27.7% during the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, even though the CO2 alone increased yield by 3.5 to 12.8% for the scenario representing ensembles of 112 projections (S1). The yield decrease was linearly related to the shortening of the growing period caused by increased temperature. Under deficit irrigation, the yield decreases were smaller due to increased WUE with elevated CO2. Because of the shortened crop growing period and the CO2 effect of decreasing the ET demand, there was a decrease in the required irrigation. Longer duration cultivars tolerant to higher temperatures may be one of the possible adaptation strategies. The amount of irrigation water needed to maintain the current yield for a longer duration corn cultivar, having the same WUE as the current cultivar, is projected to change in the range of \textminus{}1.7 to 6.4% from the current baseline, under the four different scenarios of climate change evaluated in this research.}

Future water and food security will depend, among other factors, on the impact of climate change on water demand for irrigation. Using a recently developed global irrigation model, with a spatial resolution of 0.5\textdegree{} by 0.5\textdegree{}, we present the first global analysis of the impact of climate change and climate variability on irrigation water requirements. We compute how long-term average irrigation requirements might change under the climatic conditions of the 2020s and the 2070s, as provided by two climate models, and relate these changes to the variations in irrigation requirements caused by long-term and interannual climate variability in the 20th century. Two-thirds of the global area equipped for irrigation in 1995 will possibly suffer from increased water requirements, and on up to half of the total area (depending on the measure of variability), the negative impact of climate change is more significant than that of climate variability.}

  abstract  = {Irrigated production in the Guadalquivir river basin in Spain has grown significantly over the last decade. As a consequence, water resources are under severe pressure, with an increasing deficit between available supplies and water demand. To conserve supplies, the water authority has reduced the volume of water assigned to each irrigation district. Major infrastructural investments have also been made to improve irrigation efficiency, including the adoption of high technology micro-irrigation systems. Within a context of increasing water scarcity, climate change threatens to exacerbate the current supply-demand imbalance. In this study, the impacts of climate change on irrigation water demand have been modelled and mapped. Using a combination of crop and geographic information systems, maps showing the predicted spatial impacts of changes in agroclimate (climate variables that determine the irrigation requirements) and irrigation need have been produced. The maps highlight a significant predicted increase in aridity and irrigation need. Modelling of irrigation water requirements shows a typical increase of between 15 and 20% in seasonal irrigation need by the 2050s, depending on location and cropping pattern, coupled with changes in seasonal timing of demand.}

Future climate change scenarios suggest that the Western Australian wheat-belt is likely to see greater future reductions in rainfall than other regions, together with a further increase in temperatures. While these changes appear adverse for water-limited rain-fed agriculture, a close analysis of the changes and their impacts reveals a more complex story. Twentieth century changes in rainfall, temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration have had little or no overall impact on wheat yields. Changes in agricultural technology and farming systems have had much larger impacts. Contrary to some claims, there is no scientific or economic justification for any immediate actions by farmers to adapt to long-term climate change in the Western Australian wheat-belt, beyond normal responses to short-term variations in weather. Rather than promoting current change, the most important policy response is research and development to enable farmers to facilitate future adaptation to climate change. Research priorities are proposed.}
