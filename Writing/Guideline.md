# Nature Sustainability:

An Article is a substantial, novel research study of high quality and broad interest to the various fields contributing to sustainability research. Articles often draw on several techniques or approaches. The main text (excluding the abstract, Methods section, references, tables and figure legends) is limited to 3,500 words. Articles can have up to 6 display items (figures and/or tables). As a guideline, Articles allow up to 50 references (excluding those cited exclusively in Methods). Footnotes are not used. The maximum title length is 90 characters (including spaces). The abstract should be no more than 150 words and is unreferenced; it contains a brief account of the background and rationale of the work, followed by a statement of the main conclusions introduced by the phrase "Here we show" or some equivalent. An introduction (without heading) of up to 500 words of referenced text expands on the background to the work (some overlap with the abstract is acceptable), and is followed by a concise, focused account of the findings, ending with one or two short paragraphs of discussion. Both the main text and the following Methods section should be divided by succinct topical headings of no more than 60 characters (including spaces) to aid readers. Methods can be up to 3,000 words. It can include equations but should not include figures and tables; references in the Methods are unlimited.
